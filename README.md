## Netflix Content Strategy Optimization: Data Cleaning and Analysis Using SQL  

---

## Overview  
This project demonstrates how SQL can be leveraged for data cleaning and exploratory analysis on a Netflix dataset. The goal is to improve data quality, analyze content trends, and uncover actionable insights about Netflix's content production, regional availability, and audience engagement. The insights aim to inform content strategy decisions and optimize platform performance.

## Business Problem  
Netflix’s global success relies on understanding content trends, regional preferences, and viewer engagement. This project addresses crucial business questions:

- How can data inconsistencies and missing values be cleaned to enable accurate and actionable insights?  
- What trends exist in content types, genres, and production locations, and how can these trends inform strategic decisions?  
- Which genres and content strategies resonate most with regional audiences, specifically in high-demand markets like the USA?

## Data Cleaning  
In this project, the dataset was cleaned to ensure data accuracy and readiness for analysis. The key steps included:

1. **Handling Missing Values**  
   - Replaced NULL values with appropriate placeholders (e.g., **'Unknown'**, **0**) in crucial columns like `title`, `genres`, `releaseYear`, and `imdbRating`.  

2. **Standardizing Data Formats**  
   - Converted `genres` and `type` to lowercase to maintain consistency.  
   - Standardized movie titles to proper casing for better readability.

3. **Removing Duplicates**  
   - Identified and removed duplicate rows by focusing on key attributes like `title` and `releaseYear`.
These steps ensured a clean, structured dataset, enabling reliable analysis of Netflix’s content trends and insights into genres, production patterns, and audience preferences.
